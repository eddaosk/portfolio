                            <p>For our second-semester exam project, we created a SaaS concept to help JuicOrganic shift from B2B to B2C. Our idea was a smart vending machine that lets users refill sustainable juice bottles and encourages eco-friendly habits through digital interaction.</p>
                            <p>My main focus was on UX research — I conducted interviews, built personas and user journeys, and analyzed the data to understand user needs. I was also responsible for the information architecture and front-end development using JavaScript, HTML, SCSS, and Bootstrap. On top of that, I designed and animated the After Effects video used to promote the vending machine and as part of the social media campaign.</p>
                            <p>We followed a design thinking process and tested our concept multiple times, refining it with each round of feedback. The final result was a user-centred prototype that brings sustainability, accessibility, and technology together in one smooth digital experience.</p>

                            <p>In this project, we formed a nine-person digital design agency delivering visual identities, branding, and Figma prototypes for real clients. The focus was on user-centred design, creative direction, and strong collaboration.</p>
                            <p>My main role was project coordination and management. I oversaw the workflow, led stand-ups, and kept communication running smoothly across the team. I also matched people to tasks based on their strengths and contributed to UX research, client communication, and Figma design work.</p>
                            <p>Throughout the process, I helped maintain a positive team dynamic by encouraging open communication, supporting others when needed, and creating space for everyone to set their own goals and push their skills a bit further. At the final showcase, our group received strong feedback for our teamwork and communication, both from teachers and fellow students and was voted one of the teams other students would most like to work with.</p>

                            <p>Our task was to develop a clear brand identity and create a user-centred website prototype. The main challenge was UX: guiding users through a complex, information-heavy product in a way that felt intuitive and engaging.</p>
                            <p>I led the UX direction and collaborated closely with the team as we conducted user research, developed personas and user journeys, created the information architecture, and applied persuasive design principles to optimise the flow. Together, we transformed a jargon-heavy concept into a more approachable and structured experience.</p>
                            <p>The final result was a clean, streamlined website prototype that simplifies financial information, improves clarity, and guides users smoothly toward conversion, making the product feel more accessible and trustworthy.</p>

                            <p>For this project, I contributed an article that interprets the theme through both text and visuals. I wrote the article, designed the layout, and took all photographs. Throughout the process, I applied design principles, Gestalt laws, grid systems, visual hierarchy, and typography to create a cohesive and engaging editorial experience. This project helped me deepen my understanding of visual storytelling, strengthen my design abilities, and explore how photography can be used as a narrative medium.</p>

The concept blends Western aesthetics with techno and underground influences, resulting in a bold and playful visual identity.</p>
                            <p>I managed the project and group work using a Kanban board and worked on SEO, business modelling, persuasive design, Figma prototyping, and product development. I also helped shape the brand’s visual identity and created SoMe content.</p>
                            <p>The outcome was a strong brand identity and tested product line, developed through the Lean Startup method, user feedback, and close collaboration with Copenhagen’s queer community. All profits from the project were donated to LGBT Asylum.</p>
